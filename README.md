# PlayStation 2023 website clone

For my web development course, our practice exam consisted of creating a 1:1 clone of the 2023 Sony PlayStation website. I finished it about 3/4rd's through, using primarily HTML semantics and flexbox. I've uploaded it to showcase that with a simple reference image and some HTML and CSS knowledge, you can quickly create an amazing website from scratch using only two basic languages.
